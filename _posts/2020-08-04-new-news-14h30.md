with extra tag `regenerate: true`  

via https://community.netlify.com/t/post-created-published-on-github-dont-show-up-in-generated-site/19752/4

got feedback to add `regenerate: true`

allthough localy it build without the tag; deploy on netlify did not do the trick.

Hopefully now everything shows up from the first time
